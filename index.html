            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="fourth-sec">
                    <p>Quite honestly, we can’t think of one.</p>
                </div> 
                <br>
                <div class="first-set">
                    <p>At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no 
                
                    declaration of love more apparent than <br>  building a marble
                
                    masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to 
                
                    travel than seeing <br> its magnificence up close.</p>
                     <br>   
                    <p>After all, this is art. Built in Agra, <strong><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india" style="color: #A71F50;">India</a></strong> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s <br> the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj <br> Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from <br> Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond), <br> and so much more…</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian <br> men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour. <br> Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from  <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/indias-golden-triangle-143456" style="color: #A71F50;">8-day Golden Triangle tours</a></span> (now with <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india" style="color: #A71F50;">solo-only <br> departures!)</a></span> to 15-day trips dedicated to food, to 19-day trips combining the highlights of India <br> and Nepal.</p>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <p>The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally <br> prepared, you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have <br> minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:</p>
                    <br>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>Passport</li>
                        <li>Money</li>
                        <li>Water</li>
                        <li>Medicine</li>
                        <li>Camera</li>
                        <li>Phone</li>
                    </ul>
                   
                    <br>
                    <h2>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h2> 
                    <br>
                    <p>There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will <br> need to cover your head, shoulders and knees.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear <br> sunscreen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:</p>

                    <h2>Other things you need to know</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>No food is allowed inside.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with. <br> Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small <br> video cameras) are not allowed.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>When you’re at the Taj Mahal</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if <br> possible).</p>
                    <br>
                    <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/India_Agra_taj_mahal_crowds_185.jpg" alt="pic-5" height="400" width="650">
                    <br>
                    <p>If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an <br> amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to <br> take you there and back cheaply.)</p>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <p>She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise <br> on a clear day.</p>

                    <h2>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit <br> on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.</p>
                    <br>
                    <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_agra_taj-mahal_taking-in-the-surroundings.jpg" alt="pic-7" height="400" width="650">
                    <br>
                    <p>But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth <br> seeking out.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/pravin-intrepid-manager-gender-equality-india/" style="color: #A71F50;">Pravin<br> Tamang</a></span>. (His photography is amazing – check it out!)</p>

                        <li>Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main <br> platform</li>
                        <li>Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li>
                        <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li>
                        <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="third-set">

                
                    <br>
                    <p>You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal. <br> Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the <br> day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric!</p>

                    <h2>What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. <br> Then explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What to do in Agra</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort is <br> also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century <br> Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Where to go outside of Agra</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these, <br> Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places.</p>
                    <br>
                    <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_orchha_temple.jpg" alt="pic-9" height="400" width="650">
                    <p>Chaturbhuj Temple in Orchha</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/top-colourful-cities/" style="color: #A71F50;">‘Pink City’</a></span>, the capital of Rajasthan is full of <br> chaos, charm and unique architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting <br> bazaars, and consider taking a hot air balloon over the city to take it all in.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>As you may have read or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very thorough <br> clean. Yep, to be precise, a mud mask as of April 2018.</p>
